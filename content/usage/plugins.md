>How do I use a plugin? 

Command Line
--------------------------------------

If you are using lessc, the first thing you need to do is install that plugin. We recommend the plugin starts with "less-plugin" though that isn't required. For the clean-css plugin you would install with
```
npm install less-plugin-clean-css
```

To use the plugin, if you specify a unrecognised option, we attempt to load that, for example
```
lessc --clean-css="advanced"
```

Will use the plugin you just installed. You can also be more direct, for example

```
lessc --plugin=path_to_plugin=options
```

Using a Plugin in Code
----------------------

In Node, require the plugin and pass it to less in an array as an option plugins. E.g.

```js
var myPlugin = require("my-plugin");
less.render(myCSS, { plugins: [myPlugin] })
   .then(function(output) {
    },
    function(error) {
    });
```

In the Browser
-------------------

Plugin authors should provide a javascript file, just include that in the page *before* the less.js script.

```html
<script src="plugin.js"></script>
<script>
less = { 
    plugins: [plugin]
};
</script>  
<script src="less.min.js"></script>
```

<!-- TODO: 
  * titles of the wrapped-up libraries/frameworks should be links 
    e.g. Bootstrap -> [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) etc.
  * invent something to use instead of `import Bla-bla`, `import Blee-bloo`

For Plugin Authors
--------------------------

LESS supports some entry points that allow an author to integrate with less. We may add some more in the future.

The plugin itself has a very simple signature, like this
```js
{
    install: function(less, pluginManager) {
    },
    minVersion: [2, 0, 0] /* optional */
}
```
So, the plugin gets the less object, which in v2 has more classes on it (making it easy to extend), a plugin manager which provides some hooks to add visitors, file managers and post processors.

If your plugin supports `lessc`, there are a few more details and the signature looks like this

```js
{
    install: function(less, pluginManager) {
    },
    setOptions: function(argumentString) { /* optional */
    },
    printUsage: function() { /* optional */
    },
    minVersion: [2, 0, 0] /* optional */
}
```
The additions are the `setOptions` function which passes the string the user enters when specifying your plugin and also the `printUsage` function which you should use to explain your options and how the plugin works.

Here are some example repos showing the different plugin types:
 - post-processor: https://github.com/less/less-plugin-clean-css
 - visitor: https://github.com/less/less-plugin-inline-urls
 - file-manager: https://github.com/less/less-plugin-npm-import

Note: Plugins are different from creating a version of less for a different environment but they do have similarities, for example node provides 2 file managers by default and browser provides one and that is the main step in getting less to run within a specific environment. The plugin allows you to add file managers.
