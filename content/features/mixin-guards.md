# Mixin Guards
> Conditional mixins

Guards are useful when you want to match on *expressions*, as opposed to simple values or arity. If you are
familiar with functional programming, you have probably encountered them already.

In trying to stay as close as possible to the declarative nature of CSS, LESS has opted to implement
conditional execution via **guarded mixins** instead of if/else statements, in the vein of `@media`
query feature specifications.

Let's start with an example:

```less
.mixin (@a) when (lightness(@a) >= 50%) {
  background-color: black;
}
.mixin (@a) when (lightness(@a) < 50%) {
  background-color: white;
}
.mixin (@a) {
  color: @a;
}
```

The key is the **`when`** keyword, which introduces a guard sequence (here with only one guard). Now if we run the following
code:

```less
.class1 { .mixin(#ddd) }
.class2 { .mixin(#555) }
```

Here's what we'll get:

```css
.class1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: #ddd;
}
.class2 {
  background-color: white;
  color: #555;
}
```

The full list of comparison operators usable in guards are: **`> >= = =< <`**. Additionally, the keyword `true`
is the only truthy value, making these two mixins equivalent:

```
.truth (@a) when (@a) { ... }
.truth (@a) when (@a = true) { ... }
```

Any value other than the keyword `true` is falsy:

```less
.class {
  .truth(40); // Will not match any of the above definitions.
}
```

Guards can be separated with a comma '`,`'--if any of the guards evaluates to true, it's
considered as a match:

```less
.mixin (@a) when (@a > 10), (@a < -10) { ... }
```

Note that you can also compare arguments with each other, or with non-arguments:

```
    @media: mobile;

    .mixin (@a) when (@media = mobile) { ... }
    .mixin (@a) when (@media = desktop) { ... }

    .max (@a; @b) when (@a > @b) { width: @a }
    .max (@a; @b) when (@a < @b) { width: @b }
```

Lastly, if you want to match mixins based on value type, you can use the *is\** functions:

```
    .mixin (@a; @b: 0) when (isnumber(@b)) { ... }
    .mixin (@a; @b: black) when (iscolor(@b)) { ... }
```

Here are the basic type checking functions:

* `iscolor`
* `isnumber`
* `isstring`
* `iskeyword`
* `isurl`

If you want to check if a value, in addition to being a number, is in a specific unit, you may use one of:

* `ispixel`
* `ispercentage`
* `isem`
* `isunit`

Last but not least, you may use the **`and`** keyword to provide additional conditions inside a guard:

```
    .mixin (@a) when (isnumber(@a)) and (@a > 0) { ... }
```

And the **`not`** keyword to negate conditions:

```
    .mixin (@b) when not (@b > 0) { ... }
```
